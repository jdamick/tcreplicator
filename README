TCReplicator
============

Tokyo Cabinet Replicator

This library provides the ability to replicate from a tokyo tyrant instance into
a local tokyo cabinet.  The replication uses the tyrant library for replication
and simply extracts the logic of the replicator thread that was previously in
tyrant into an embeddable library.
